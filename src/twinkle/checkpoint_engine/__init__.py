"""Checkpoint Engine for weight synchronization between trainer and rollout.

Provides NCCL/HCCL-based weight broadcast from training model workers to
inference sampler workers in STANDALONE (disaggregated) deployment mode.

Reference: https://github.com/volcengine/verl/tree/main/verl/checkpoint_engine

Usage:
    >>> from twinkle.checkpoint_engine import CheckpointEngineManager
    >>>
    >>> manager = CheckpointEngineManager(model=model, sampler=sampler)
    >>> manager.sync_weights()  # blocking call
