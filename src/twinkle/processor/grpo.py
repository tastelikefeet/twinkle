GRPO Processor for RL training.

This processor is a simple pass-through that uses the base InputProcessor.
The GRPO loss now operates on logps directly and computes loss_mask from labels,
so no special preprocessing is needed.

This file is kept for backward compatibility but can be replaced with InputProcessor.

    Processor for GRPO training.

    This is now a thin wrapper around InputProcessor since the GRPO loss
    computes loss_mask directly from labels. It exists for backward compatibility
    and can be used interchangeably with InputProcessor.

    The GRPO loss expects:
    - inputs['labels']: [batch, seq_len] target tokens, -100 for ignored positions
    - outputs['logps']: [batch, seq_len] log probabilities from current policy

    These are provided by the standard template encoding and model forward.
