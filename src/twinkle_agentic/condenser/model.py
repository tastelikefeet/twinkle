"""LLM-backed passage condenser.

Pipeline
--------
``Chunks`` → filter eligible chunks → batched ``Sampler.sample(...)`` →
strip code fences → length-vs-original guard → ``Chunks`` with
``raw.condensed=True`` (so :meth:`Chunks.to_trajectory` later wraps
them in ``<block_N>``). When the decoded output is empty, degenerate,
or **not strictly shorter than the original passage**, the chunk is
left untouched and is NOT marked ``raw.condensed`` — so downstream
bookkeeping (and the rollout trace) can tell compressed vs.
passthrough chunks apart.

The compression prompt asks for up to three markdown sections
(``## Summary / ## More / ## Key Facts``) written in **telegraphic
style** (no articles / copulas / filler) with per-section length
hints. Telegraphic output is ~2–3× denser than natural-prose summaries
and is critical under tight compression ratios. The output is **not**
parsed — sections pass through verbatim. The character budget the
prompt exposes is a soft target only; we never hard-clip the model
output, we simply discard it (fall back to the original) when it
fails to compress.

_SECTION_SCHEMA = """You are a text compression assistant. A downstream model will read your compressed output to decide whether the detail it needs is inside this block; if yes, it will fetch and read the original passage.

Downstream model workflow:
Read your compressed output -> Decide whether needed info is in this block -> If yes -> Fetch original.

Therefore your compression MUST NOT lose major information from the source.

Output format:

```text
## Summary
Overview plus facts STRONGLY RELATED to the Query, stated explicitly.

## More
A collapsed index; expansion required to see specific information.
```

Rules:
1. Telegraphic style — drop function words ("the", "a", "is", "are", "of", ...); colons and commas mean "is" / "has". 
    * Exception: KEEP role-tagging verb+preposition phrases verbatim ("published by X", "written by X", "directed by X", "starring X", "founded by X", "created by X", "composed by X", "produced by X", "based on X", "adapted from X"). Collapsing these to a bare name loses the relation role (author vs publisher vs director) that the downstream question may hinge on.
2. Summary MUST contain the passage's primary topic + 2–4 concrete core facts drawn from the source (entities, numbers, dates, relations). If a Query is given, order Query-relevant facts first, but STILL include other core facts within the budget. A Query is an ORDERING HINT, NOT a filter.
3. Summary MUST NOT be meta-commentary about the Query. Forbidden patterns: "no X mention", "Query info: absent", "passage covers Y only", "does not contain ...", "no relevant info", or summaries that are only abstract category words like "structure/order/usage" with no facts. If the passage is unrelated to the Query, you still summarize the passage normally.
4. More is an INDEX of category keywords, NOT inline data. Enumerate what CAN be recovered from the source (e.g. "birthplace, death place, age"); do NOT paste dates/numbers/names inline. Make sure all category of useful facts are introduced here.
5. Output language MUST match the source language.
6. Do NOT fabricate. Do NOT omit major information. Any fact not in the source MUST NOT appear in your output.

Example:

```text
Marie Curie (7 Nov 1867 – 4 Jul 1934), born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw (then Russian Poland); parents were teachers. Barred from Polish universities, she and her sister agreed to take turns funding each other's overseas study.

In 1891 Marie reached Paris and enrolled at the Sorbonne, earning a physics degree (1893) and a mathematics degree (1894), becoming the school's first female physics lecturer. In 1895 she married French physicist Pierre Curie; they spent the rest of their lives on radioactivity research.

In July 1898 she discovered polonium, named after her homeland Poland; in December she and Pierre announced the discovery of radium. She coined "radioactivity" and showed it is an atomic property, not a chemical reaction.

In 1903 she shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre and Henri Becquerel. In 1911 she alone won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for polonium and radium. She is the first woman to win a Nobel, and the only person to win Nobels in two different sciences. After Pierre died in a carriage accident in 1906, Marie took his chair and became the first female professor at the Sorbonne.

During World War I she developed mobile X-ray units, called "Petites Curies" in French; about 20 were deployed to the front, examining over 1,000,000 wounded soldiers.

She died of aplastic anaemia from radiation exposure on 4 July 1934 in Passy, Haute-Savoie, France, aged 66. Her notebooks remain highly radioactive, kept in lead boxes; researchers must wear protective gear to consult them.

class ModelCondenser(Condenser):
    """Compressor that delegates summarization to an LLM via a :class:`Sampler`.

    Args:
        sampler: Configured :class:`Sampler` with a template set.
        compression_ratio: Target factor (> 1). Used only to derive a
            soft character budget passed into the prompt and to size
            ``SamplingParams.max_tokens``. Model output is NOT hard
            truncated; a chunk whose decoded output is not strictly
            shorter than the original passage is left unchanged (and
            not flagged ``raw.condensed``).
        sampling_params: Override for per-call sampling; when ``None`` a
            greedy config is derived from the max budget in the batch.
        system_prompt: Override for the system prompt. Used verbatim.
        user_prompt_template: Override the user prompt. Must contain
            ``{budget}`` and ``{text}``. ``{query}`` is optional and is
            replaced with the trajectory's question extracted by the
            ``related_query`` callback (see below); jobs without a
            detected query get a neutral placeholder.
        min_chars: Pre-filter; chunks shorter than this pass through.
        min_budget_chars: Floor for the soft character budget exposed
            to the prompt. When ``ceil(len / compression_ratio)`` falls
            below this, the budget is raised to this floor so short
            passages keep room for all three sections in the model's
            plan. Since the condenser no longer hard-clips output,
            this only influences prompt wording and sampling token
            limits; pass ``1`` to use the raw ratio everywhere.
        template: Optional :class:`Template`. When provided, its
            ``tokenizer.all_special_tokens`` are stripped from every
            decoded response before length-clamping, preventing
            protocol tokens (``<|im_end|>``, ``<|eot_id|>``, ``</s>``,
            ...) from leaking into the compressed output. When
            omitted, falls back to ``sampler.template`` if available.
        skip_roles: Roles whose chunks are never compressed.
        skip_pattern: Optional regex (compiled with ``re.MULTILINE``).
            Any chunk whose ``content`` has a match for this pattern
            is passed through unchanged, regardless of length / ratio.
            Uses :func:`re.search` semantics, so anchor with ``^`` /
            start-of-string if you want boundary-matching only (e.g.
            ``r'^Question:'`` to preserve the question prefix in a
            HotpotQA-style user message). ``None`` disables the filter.
            This flag is purely a compression-skip filter; query
            extraction is the orthogonal job of ``related_query``.
        related_query: Optional ``(chunk) -> Optional[str]`` callback
            that returns the query string carried by ``chunk`` (e.g.
            the user's HotpotQA question), or ``None`` if the chunk
            is not a query carrier. Walked in chunk order; the most
            recently returned non-``None`` query is broadcast to all
            subsequent condense-eligible chunks until the next hit.
            Because :class:`MultiTurnCondenseRollout` may merge
            multiple trajectories into one chunk list, each
            trajectory's question chunk must precede its passages so
            this rolling state correctly partitions queries
            per-trajectory. ``None`` disables query injection (the
            ``{query}`` slot collapses to a neutral placeholder).
        rounds: Optional set of conversation turn indices to compress.
            ``None`` = no round-based filter; chunks lacking a ``round``
            field are skipped when this filter is active.
        batch_size: Max chunks per sampler call. Partial batches are
            padded with a duplicate of the last trajectory so that
            distributed samplers (DP slice) always receive a full batch.
        lora_path: Optional LoRA adapter to use for compression.
            - ``None`` (default): forwards ``use_base_model=True`` to
              :meth:`Sampler.sample` so compression bypasses any
              currently-synced LoRA — strongly recommended when the
              sampler is also the training policy.
            - ``str``: forwards ``adapter_path=lora_path`` so a
              dedicated condenser LoRA (e.g. a ModelScope slug or
              local directory) is loaded and used instead of the base.

    Compressed chunks are flagged ``raw.condensed=True``; a subsequent
    :meth:`Chunks.to_trajectory` call wraps them in ``<block_N>``.
